Saint of the Day (SotD)

This plugin is being rolled into the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/liturgical-day-of-the-week/" target="_blank">Liturgical Day of the Week</a> plugin, since so many of the same features are already present in both. Please uninstall this one and install the LDotW plugin.

It will be removed from the WordPress.org repositories early January 2024.

**Current Version 1.0.2**

= Features: = 
* Shortcode builder allows you to decide if you want to show the background color (and it's "partner" text color) or not.
* Works anywhere you can use shortcode.
* Only background color and text color defined via CSS. You can control the look/feel by adding your own CSS styling to a specific CSS class.

This plugin is not compatible with WordPress versions less than 5.0. Requires PHP 5.6+.

= TROUBLESHOOTING: =
* Check the FAQs/Help located on WordPress' Plugin page, or the Support forum on WordPress.org's plugin area.
* The Shortcode Builder has been extensively tested with both jQuery version 1.12.4 and 3.5.1, without any issues. The output, however, does not need jQuery/JavaScript.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
** As this is the first release of SotD, FAQs are a little minimal right now ** 

= Why shut down the SotD Plugin? =
Because there's a LOT of similar functionality with both plugins, including identical data sets. Easier to enhance one plugin slightly and maintain it, than it is to maintain two separate plugins.
